Rules

Reversi is played on an 8x8 board with two players taking turns. Each player places a disc to capture opponent discs by surrounding them horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Captured discs are flipped to the player's color. The game ends when no more legal moves are available, and the player with the most discs wins.

Unflippable Disc (â­•): Immune to flipping.

Bomb Disc (ðŸ’£): Explodes and flips adjacent discs, triggering chain reactions with other Bomb Discs.
